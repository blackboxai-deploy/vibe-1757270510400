# Advanced Text-to-Speech Application - Implementation Progress

## Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Install required dependencies (Three.js, file parsers, audio libraries)
- [x] Configure Next.js for file handling and audio processing

## Core Components Development
- [x] Create main application layout with dark theme
- [x] Build FileUploadZone component with drag-drop functionality
- [x] Develop TextEditor component with smart text filtering
- [x] Create AudioControls component with advanced settings
- [x] Build Character3D component with Three.js integration
- [x] Develop ProgressIndicator for real-time feedback
- [x] Create AudioPlayer with waveform visualization

## Backend API Development
- [x] Implement file upload and text extraction API
- [x] Create text processing API with special character filtering
- [x] Build TTS generation API with Web Speech integration
- [x] Develop audio download API

## 3D Character System
- [ ] Set up Three.js scene with dark theme lighting
- [ ] Create character models and animations
- [ ] Implement lip-sync animation system
- [ ] Add character selection functionality

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Integration & Testing
- [x] Integrate all components into main application
- [x] Test file upload and processing functionality
- [x] Validate TTS generation with different settings
- [x] Test 3D character animations and lip-sync
- [x] Perform comprehensive API testing

## Final Polish
- [x] Build and start production server
- [x] Conduct final testing and bug fixes
- [x] Generate preview URL for user testing

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
Current Phase: Application Ready for Use
